# human_genx

A combination of flutter , dl pix2pix model and backend as django .
Human Generator" is a Flutter mobile application designed for artistic expression, utilizing cutting-edge technology to transform user-input sketches into realistic human faces. The frontend, developed with Flutter, offers a seamless and intuitive user experience, incorporating Firebase Authentication for secure login.

The application's backend, powered by Django Rest Framework, serves as the computational engine. It employs the Pix2Pix algorithm, a powerful deep learning model implemented using Keras and TensorFlow. This algorithm learns intricate mappings between input sketches and corresponding lifelike images of human faces.

Users log in securely through Firebase Authentication, submit their sketches through the Flutter interface, and seamlessly receive generated images back from the Django backend. The integration of these technologies creates a captivating and innovative platform that merges art and artificial intelligence.
